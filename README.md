# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This Project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in a person using Machine Learning techniques, specially **Logistic Regression**.
The model is trained on a dataset containing various health related parameters to classify whether a person has Heart disease (1) or not (0).

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes features such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type (cp)
- Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)
- Cholesterol (chol)
- Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)
- Resting ECG (restecg)
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)
- Exercise-Included Angina (exang)
- ST Depression (oldpeak)
- Slope of ST Segment (slope)
- No.of Major vessela (ca)
- Thalassemia (thal)

The Target Variable is:
- target
  - 0 -> No Heart Disease
  - 1 -> Has Heart Disease
### Language Used:
 - Python
### Libraries Used:
 - pandas (Data Processing)
  
 - numpy (numerical operations)
  
 - matplotlib & seaborn (visualisation)
  
 - scikit-learn (Machine Learning Model)

## Results
  - The Model achieved on **accuracy of 83%** on train dataset
  - The model achieved on **accuracy of 88%** on test dataset
